# Interview-Kit
This repository is specially for non CS students who are new into programming and seeking a way or guide to crack interviews for IT companies. 
I being an Electrical enginner started my first "Hello World" in my 3rd year of college, faced many problems to get a place in IT sector. So I created this repository for the non CS back ground students where one can find all the necessary programs from Adding Two Integers to Reverse of a Binary Tree.
